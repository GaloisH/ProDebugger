"""The action space.

Three families. Steering moves the focus and reports what it passed through, so
the direction is the caller's and the path is the record's. Evidence gathers at
a focus. Framing opens and closes an investigation.

The set is closed. That is what makes an investigation reproducible, auditable
and countable. Nothing here decides where to go next; that is the caller's job,
which is why the search is a subgraph rather than a path or a binary tree.
