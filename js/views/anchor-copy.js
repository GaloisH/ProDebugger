Counter/gap: later unquoted 'look' (steps 6/8/14/16/22/24) also yields 'you see nothing', so quoting alone may not be the sole cause, and the reflection (fid32) notices failure but never the format.",

Necessary subgoal affected: correct belief about which containers have actually been reached/searched, needed to direct the keychain search. Support: changes list fid45, and later phantom fids (73,80,94,101,163,203) plus precondition target_visible cited [19,45,66,94,163].

Necessary subgoal affected: systematic container search for the keychain. Support: step12 audits, repeated no-effect with admissibility 'quoted'.

Necessary subgoal affected: locating the keychain before any take/put can occur. Support: step17 audits, invalid_steps covering prior identical actions. Counter: the same quoted pattern was not consistently fatal across the run (step25 unquoted worked), so the fault is intermittent formatting rather than a stable wrong decision.",

Necessary subgoal affected: productive exploration for the keychain. Support: step21 audits.

Necessary subgoal affected: finding the keychain and then obtaining/placing it. Support: step26 audits, changes fid203/204, env arrival fid197/199.

No keychain was ever located and no take/put was ever attempted; the requirement stays unmet with no decision step. Necessary subgoal affected: obtain keychain and put on sidetable.
